# AGU-2019

Here are my materials from AGU 2019 in San Francisco, CA.  

The following support the development of an interactive tool using Google Earth Engine
for determining areas where sensors are best suited to observe snow properties.
The poster considers Passive Microwave and Optical sensors. The "Stop Light" Chart considers 
all current ground, airborne, and satellite sensors.
